Dirac's free particle equation was developed to linearly express the relativistic relation between energy and momentum. The Dirac oscillator, a Dirac equation linear in both momentum and coordinates, which reduces to a harmonic oscillator with strong spin-orbit coupling in the non-relativistic limit.
