Following overview is based on youtube video [Yang-Mills for Mathematicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29v0B2Fol3k) by Sourav Chatterjee.

- Quantum field theories (QFTs) are fundamental frameworks in physics that explain the interactions between elementary particles and make predictions about their behaviors.

- The framework of quantum field theory is encapsulated by the Standard Model, which describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force.
- Yang-Mills theories are specific types of quantum field theories that form the foundation of the Standard Model, particularly in describing the strong and weak nuclear forces.
- What is a quantum field theory (QFT)? This remains an open question, not only in the realm of mathematics but also in physics. Despite its extensive use, a complete and rigorous definition of QFT is still elusive.
- Remarkably, physicists can perform calculations and make surprisingly accurate predictions using QFTs, even without a full understanding of the underlying mathematical structure.
- The rigorous mathematical construction of quantum field theories, especially Yang-Mills theories, is one of the seven "Millennium Prize Problems" posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, with a prize of $1 million for a solution.
