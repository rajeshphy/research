This procedure was known as the eightfold way of Gell-Mann and Neeman. Questions arose about bigger multiplets including particles of different spins.     In a famous No-go theorem (Coleman, Mandula 1967), it was stated that the most general symmetry of the S-matrix is Poincaré × internal, which cannot mix different spins (for example), if you still require there to be interactions.  Golfand and Likhtman (1971) extended the Poincaré algebra to include spinor generators $ Q_\\alpha $, where $ \\alpha = 1, 2 $.  Ramond, Neveu-Schwarz, Gervais, and Sakita (1971) devised supersymmetry in 2 dimensions (from string theory).  Wess and Zumino (1974) wrote down supersymmetric field theories in 4 dimensions. They opened the way for many other contributions to the field. This is often seen as the actual starting point for systematic study of supersymmetry.  Haag, Lopuszanski, and Sohnius (1975) generalized the Coleman-Mandula theorem to show that the only non-trivial quantum field theories have a symmetry group of super Poincaré group in a direct product with internal symmetries.","categories": ["research"],

        "excerpt":"Following overview is based on youtube video Yang-Mills for Mathematicians by Sourav Chatterjee.       Quantum field theories (QFTs) are fundamental frameworks in physics that explain the interactions between elementary particles and make predictions about their behaviors.     The framework of quantum field theory is encapsulated by the Standard Model, which describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature: electromagnetism, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force.  Yang-Mills theories are specific types of quantum field theories that form the foundation of the Standard Model, particularly in describing the strong and weak nuclear forces.  What is a quantum field theory (QFT)? This remains an open question, not only in the realm of mathematics but also in physics. Despite its extensive use, a complete and rigorous definition of QFT is still elusive.  Remarkably, physicists can perform calculations and make surprisingly accurate predictions using QFTs, even without a full understanding of the underlying mathematical structure.  The rigorous mathematical construction of quantum field theories, especially Yang-Mills theories, is one of the seven “Millennium Prize Problems” posed by the Clay Mathematics Institute, with a prize of $1 million for a solution.","categories": ["research"],

This unique coupling results in a distinct energy spectrum and degeneracy structure, which sets it apart from the conventional quantum harmonic oscillator.
