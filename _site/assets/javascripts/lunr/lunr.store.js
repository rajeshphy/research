This procedure was known as the eightfold way of Gell-Mann and Neeman. Questions arose about bigger multiplets including particles of different spins.     In a famous No-go theorem (Coleman, Mandula 1967), it was stated that the most general symmetry of the S-matrix is Poincaré × internal, which cannot mix different spins (for example), if you still require there to be interactions.  Golfand and Likhtman (1971) extended the Poincaré algebra to include spinor generators $ Q_\\alpha $, where $ \\alpha = 1, 2 $.  Ramond, Neveu-Schwarz, Gervais, and Sakita (1971) devised supersymmetry in 2 dimensions (from string theory).  Wess and Zumino (1974) wrote down supersymmetric field theories in 4 dimensions. They opened the way for many other contributions to the field. This is often seen as the actual starting point for systematic study of supersymmetry.  Haag, Lopuszanski, and Sohnius (1975) generalized the Coleman-Mandula theorem to show that the only non-trivial quantum field theories have a symmetry group of super Poincaré group in a direct product with internal symmetries.","categories": ["research"],

        "excerpt":"PT symmetry is a concept in quantum mechanics that was introduced in the 1990s. It is based on the idea that the laws of physics should be invariant under the combined operations of parity (P) and time reversal (T). In other words, if a system is symmetric under the combined operations of parity and time reversal, it is said to exhibit PT symmetry.
